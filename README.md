# Pong Game in Python with Turtle
## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle Graphics library. It's a two-player game where each player controls a paddle on either side of the screen to hit a bouncing ball. The goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to make it pass your opponent's paddle.

## Features
Simple Graphics: Utilizes Python's built-in Turtle library for drawing the game elements.
Keyboard Controls: Players use the keyboard to move the paddles up and down.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of and displays each player's score.
## How to Run
To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. This code is compatible with Python 3.

Copy the code into a file named poong.py.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved poong.py
Run the command python poong.py or python3 poong.py (depending on your Python installation).
Once the game window opens, use the W and S keys for Player A (left paddle) and the Arrow keys (Up and Down) for Player B (right paddle) to control the paddles.
## What I Learned
Basic Python Syntax: Understanding variables, functions, and control structures in Python.
Event Handling: Implementing keyboard events to control the game characters.
Collision Detection: Checking for collisions between the ball and paddles or boundaries.
Game Loop Logic: Creating an infinite loop to continuously update the game state.
Using Turtle Graphics: Learning to use Python's Turtle library for simple GUI and animations.
